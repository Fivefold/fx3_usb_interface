    This application also demonstrates the use of the endpoint specific CYU3P_USBEP_SS_RESET_EVT
    event to detect and recover from potential USB data corruption due to protocol level errors.

    The application makes use a simple GPIF configuration which continually latches the state
    of the GPIF data pins and fills them into full data packets to be sent to the USB host through
    a BULK-IN endpoint. The GPIF configuration and DMA data path are setup to facilitate the fastest
    possible data transfer. By default, the data streaming is done through an AUTO DMA channel;
    but this can be changed to a MANUAL DMA channel using the STREAMING_MANUAL pre-processor
    definition below. When the MANUAL DMA channel is used, the firmware modifies the first and
    last bytes of each 1 KB of data with a sequential number pattern; so that we can check for
    any missing data.

    The application also implements a pair of BULK-OUT and BULK-IN endpoints configured in a
    data loop back configuration. This data loop-back is done with firmware intervention using
    a pair of MANUAL-IN and MANUAL-OUT DMA channels. This can be changed to a hardware based
    AUTO loopback using the LOOPBACK_AUTO pre-processor definition.

    This application allows continuous data transfers from GPIF to USB. it is based on the official
    bulk source sink example of Cypress.
